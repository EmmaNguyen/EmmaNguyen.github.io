<p>My name is Nguyen Thi Minh Phuong, an aspiring independent researcher working on machine learning and cognitive science. My interest lies between mathematics, computer science and neuroscience with an ultimate goal to understand how human brain works and create an intelligent agent capable to emulate the thinking process.</p>

<p>In many years, I travel around the world to expand research and gain more skills, however, the very first experience comes from an undergraduate class in Vietnam when I am so deeply intrigued by an unfamiliar topic in an unexplainable way. It’s about applying Poincaré’s theorem, a prize-winning famous problem, to fix some deficits in 3D brain image reconstruction. Though that project is not successful, however, it could not stop me from learning and pursuing my interest.</p>

<p>Since then, I learn more about topology, which is a branch of mathematics which studies about invariant properties under continuous transformation, and end up by writing a dissertation with an absolute score. After that, I move to France to work on a computational model to study a diffusion of water molecules in brain grey matter by stimulating network of dendrites and applying numerical analysis. A half year later, I re-allocate to Singapore to learn information system, especially machine learning. However, gradually, I realize that to push more further progress, my research requires me to push myself away from a comfort zone. It’s a main reason why I withdrawn from a Ph.D. program to continue working on my own.</p>

<p>Four months later, while expanding research to mathematics, computer science and neuroscience by reading a lot of papers, taking a lot online courses and open course wares and watching a lot of videos, I accidentally watch a TED video of a researcher about her journey to combat a quest of making a machine ‘see’. Inspired by her talk, I register a big-data competition for computer vision called ImageNet, and luckily become one of a very few people around the world granted an access to a super computer that allows me to train my first artificial neural network. After that competition, I decide to acquire more engineering skill to accomplish more work, hence how I found out my learning community, Galvanize, located in San Francisco, United States.</p>

<p>After 8 months of waiting, I finally arrive in the Bay Area as a recipient of Women Scholarship sponsored by IBM to participate a program called Data Immersive. Thank to this, I get an opportunity to take part in some top technology events in an area to learn more skills as well as technology culture. One of them is a Deep Learning School at Stanford University, where I learn more about the field and community by attending lectures of top researchers in the field. After finishing the program, I decide to continue my work as a research scientist and professor in university. To make that wish come true, I need to come back academia to continue my research on brain, mind and machine.</p>
