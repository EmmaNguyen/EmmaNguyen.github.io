<p>Such a music. I can not sleep. “What did they put into my coffee in the afternoon?” Too much robusta. Probably.</p>

<p>On the bed, I keep thinking and cannot close my eyes. There are many things wandering in my mind. My research. My work. My experience while interacting with people and community in Saigon. And a very serious question, if another time I decide to return to Vietnam, what would I be? Such a painful question…</p>

<p>Three years for a research. Gradually, I start to see more and more resonance. I miss Algebraic Topology. I miss neuroscience. I miss everything related to my research. There is a step and an experiment I am trying to build to close a gap between what I want and what I can do. To do that I have to jump out of my comfort zone several times by taking tough decisions and actions. Applying to big companies, traveling to American, living with them and learning like them in only three months with jet lag and culture shock and American accents. And returning to academia after all of those effort to get a good job in industry and now living as a poor lonely person to complete the work with no idea where I would be in the next three months, six months, and later on.</p>

<p>When leaving Singapore, my plan was to start my own research and trying to work in some companies to earn more skills and experience until I am strong enough to found a lab or a start-up for that crazy idea. Pretending that I did not see an email from Harvard Business School and trying to tell myself that I made a vow. Yes, it was a 2-way protection preventing me from making a crazy decision such that not dropping out of a program and coming back to any. It was a very appealing invitation, but I did not feel connected to it and what was burning in my heart.</p>

<p>Silently I worked alone in a room and tried to save as much as possible to keep that situation as long as possible until I had to make a move. A large-scale experiment with 50G from a well-known competition with the newest technology sponsored by Nvidia. I was very happy to run my first experiment with a much more smaller data set. It took me more than two days and there was something weird in the system. Looked like that it has not been utilized all the resources of the machine. In spite of successfully managing all python packages, I could not do any further intervention because of lacking engineering skills. I needed help and asked around to see if any company was doing. Very few of them and the bar was quite high to let me be in, however, even though I did manage an interview with a top tech company, I realized that we would not work at the same thing. I make a bold decision: OK, no way in, let try in my best to push my application to travel to American even if I have to break a vow.</p>

<p>And I made it. The first day, when I woke up in America, the CEO of that company accidentally like a picture I took in Vietnam. Nonetheless, that interesting moment soon disappeared because my computer was out of battery and then I realized that my plug does not match into a local plug. I tried to ask a friend for help but seems hopeless. Then I thought, well let go around and ask local people. I took a bus to a downtown, then walked into electronic shopping centers. No transition. I can not remember how many shops I went, but it was a nightmare. I decided to stop after walking for a while on the highway. Too far-away and my phone was running out battery soon too. Let come back. Fortunately, I was very close to the house when it ran out of batter and thank my superior photographic memory, everything was reconstructed in mind and somehow I navigated in the right way and found out the way back home. But the door was locked. I have no key. Ringing the bell many times I see nobody coming out for a while until I see my friend’s husband come out. Weird! I asked him “Have not you gone to work?” “No, I was still at home and applying for jobs” Then he said to me that he was learning python and trying to do some collaborative work with my friend. I was very happy for that. My interest in research at that moment was a mind-control device. He also came from the University of Florida, a university has launched a competition to control the drone by a mind reading. And I was a big fan of it.</p>

<p>Indeed, another reason that makes me travel to America is a neural device called Emotiv, a headset-free device that allows us to use thought and interact with the world. However, only Emotiv does not make anything. And then there was a day I watched a video of a robot controlled by its device and in the middle is a data processing part by IBM Watson. It was. Something that I could not stop thinking.</p>

<p>When I was in Singapore, I encountered a problem that researcher was trying to find out a relation a connectivity and functionality of a brain data. I was becoming crazy because of it. What if we can integrate that connectivity with topological signatures to learn more how the brain works. Then I got stuck because of difficulties to verify this idea. Experiments on a human were considered immoral. “Deep Learning” coming at the right thing I was looking for. Something that helps us verify all of our understanding related to the human brain. Yes, it was - But the research was very challenging. It combine a lot of things that I can not feel and grasp. Still, I remembered the first online course I took seriously on coursera was clustering. But soon I realize that it does not what I feel connected.</p>

<p>Come back to Vietnam. I search in a bunch of textbooks in Mathematics and Neuroscience. Very few of them mentioned about that. The next course I took seriously was Machine Learning and then a series of many other courses in Python, Statistics, Probability, etc. Side note, there was a very interesting I realize is that I did very poor at other non-math and computer science subject. Even though I did try hard for “an introduction to marketing”, I could not get through everything and only complete around 70-80% … Such a long tail theory - I could not find any agreement why there is such a theory. Gradually, I found out myself a lot of disagreement with many claims made by statistician and probability. Uncertainty, randomness, experiment design was all of my gods. How would you be able to make such a claim and build an entire system based on it? I can not agree. The same for clustering, I cannot agree with anything based on it… though I am a researcher in unsupervised learning.</p>
