Last Sunday, I suddenly got a free ticket to participate CES - Consumer Electronics Show this year in Las Vegas. It is the most significant technology exhibition with more than 200,000 participants and 56,000 companies worldwide. I did not have much time to plan and prepare for an entire event, so I decided to follow a few top trends and tech interesting to me most. Those include wellness, wearable, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality.

One of my focus is on trying to understand the industry of healthcare, especially a section applied neuroscience. In CES, I discover a set of product targeting to improve your quality of sleep by measuring, enhancing, increasing level of awareness and unconscious while you are dreaming. One good example is a headset band to help measure neuro-activity from front lobe. It comes up with an idea of using data to measure neuron activity to a cloud and use an app to visualize data and help to detect some abnormal symptoms, then supports patients with a list of suggestion to regularize behaviors as well as medication.

The most exciting part of the exhibition is a demo which allows people to try many technologies exhibited around. Speaking of that, it’s perfect to next try with new technology in wellness, especially the headband. I am quite struggled and exhausted in CES as a late attendee to find a place to stay during an event as well as the fact that I have never been in Las Vegas and such an enormous space and fully-packed people. In the beginning, my expectation for a headset band’s result is a very fluctuating pattern showing a volatile neural activity. Nevertheless, it gives me an astonishing stable graph in two minutes of my calmness. I thought a test would be wrong because of a short measure time and a noisy environment. So I attempt to find another company to have a cross-check using heart rate. Interestingly, the result of a device shows me a very similar result. Both my status of being stress and an ability to stay away from stress is very green.

That moment a person in charge of a booth is quite surprised and asks me how I could stay so calm in such a loud environment surrounding us. So, I tell him about my practice of listening to a singing bowl to helps draw attention and increase my level of focus while working. Soon after that, a similar another takeaway note when talking to two other two companies in “Dream” industry that there is a part of what they are saying about using sound and vibration to help people faster fall asleep.

Many years ago when I read about neuro-signal and brain, researchers and scientists usually talked a lot about their observations of a pattern of sleep with alpha phase, beta phase, theta phase, and REM. With a little bit knowledge in high school physics, I learned that sound with the same frequency tended to amplify each other and create a resonance. Since then, I started to listen to music while working to see which would work for me. My personal experience said that Celt music with high-note flute and women voice along with Buddhism singing bowls are the best choices for a long time for me (Don’t know about which works best for you. But you should try). When doing (any kind) research, coding program and reading scientific or math paper, I usually listen to singing bowls to help me shape the focus and help myself into the flow faster. (And sleep, too)

In the event, I am also interested in another part of the industry tries to focus on a solution to help people, especially a group of patients in need of special aid, to practice exercise and to keep contact with the doctor and their beloved. The top idea is building an artificial intelligence assistant. Last year, I participated in one of the biggest hackathons around the world and heard people talking about this a lot. (We also build an AI assistant, too - A virtual dog) The idea to digitalize medical records and create a system to help optimize an experience is becoming more prevalent in hospital. However, after many years talking to people in industry and academia, in my opinion, the biggest challenge is data management and policy. However, the flip side is that it violates the right of a citizen to protect their information for commercial use without permission. It would take much time to let lawmakers help regulate this issue. Two companies I talked to are very experienced in the field as the first players in the field so many years long time when some very first early success of deep learning was still only discussed in a small group of the machine learning community.


In the end, what I learned is that the majority of the exhibition are about hardware rather software. Moreover, the benefit of this exhibition is the fact that you can experience the latest technology and catch up an upcoming trend as well as immediate start a discussion with a head of multiple companies around the world in one place. However, for a software company, especially a start-up, CES would not be a good fit for introducing, networking and developing business. Those are not in need of using a physical world to represent their company product because all experience in the form of internet service is online. It would take a couple of weeks (a 14-day trial is the most common offer) to give you an idea of how everything works. And not so far away from Las Vegas, there is San Francisco and its neighborhood, including the Valley - the heart of entrepreneurship and technology of the world.

Time to come back,

Las Vegas, 2019
